Log of #100DaysOfCode: 25th of July

DAY 1: Started Friday evening 24th of July 2020 and finished  half past midnight 25th of July 2020

Today's Progress: I am a newbie to coding and currently working on Responsive Web Design- I got stuck on a section of CSS Grid and I just can't seem to resolve the code. I hope tomorrow, I will figure it out. 

Time Spent: around 2hours.

Thoughts: Was feeling good until I got stuck on the 17th part of 22 sections.

DAY 2: Started Saturday evening 25th of July 2020 and finished half past midnight Sunday 26th of July 2020

Today's Progress: Day 2: I am  on my first day of  the Responsive Web Design Projects by FCC. I have made a start on the Building a Tribute page and I chose "Malala".  It just dawned on me that for a novice, I have a huge task ahead, I am going to attempt to have fun and learn a lot along this coding journey!!! 

I signed up to codepen and realised as I had a month break from starting 100daysofCode, I need to revise my first FCC lessons.

Time Spent: 2hours.

Thoughts: Nervous about this 5 part project!

Day 3: I have been working on 1 of the 5 projects for FCC's 1st challenge. And I am happy to have chosen to tribute inspirational Malala, as it makes building the  content of the project interesting  & tomorrow I am hoping to work out the padding. At first I was very daunted by the task but right now in my codepen, I see I am buidling some thing. Hopefully tomorrow, it can look more "coding" respectable.

Time spent: 1 hour half

Thoughts: Big thank you to FCC for holding my  hand & the person who came up with this challenge. I also hope that I stay motivated and enthusiastic.
