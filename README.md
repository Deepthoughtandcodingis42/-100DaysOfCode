Log of #100DaysOfCode: 25th of July

DAY 1: Started Friday evening 24th of July 2020 and finished  half past midnight 25th of July 2020

Today's Progress: I am a newbie to coding and currently working on Responsive Web Design- I got stuck on a section of CSS Grid and I just can't seem to resolve the code. I hope tomorrow, I will figure it out. 

Time Spent: around 2hours.

Thoughts: Was feeling good until I got stuck on the 17th part of 22 sections.

DAY 2: Started Saturday evening 25th of July 2020 and finished half past midnight Sunday 26th of July 2020

Today's Progress: Day 2: I am  on my first day of  the Responsive Web Design Projects by FCC. I have made a start on the Building a Tribute page and I chose "Malala".  It just dawned on me that for a novice, I have a huge task ahead, I am going to attempt to have fun and learn a lot along this coding journey!!! 

I signed up to codepen and realised as I had a month break from starting 100daysofCode, I need to revise my first FCC lessons.

Time Spent: 2hours.

Thoughts: Nervous about this 5 part project!

Day 3: I have been working on 1 of the 5 projects for FCC's 1st challenge. And I am happy to have chosen to tribute inspirational Malala, as it makes building the  content of the project interesting  & tomorrow I am hoping to work out the padding. At first I was very daunted by the task but right now in my codepen, I see I am buidling some thing. Hopefully tomorrow, it can look more "coding" respectable.

Time spent: 1 hour half


Thoughts: Big thank you to FCC for holding my  hand & the person who came up with this challenge. I also hope that I stay motivated and enthusiastic.

Day 4: I managed to squeeze an hour of coding but today was not a productive or fruitful coding day as I am exhausted.
       I also did not pursue my 1st part of  my Tribue project because with the fatigue i was feeling i wanted to see concrete results and so decided to embark onto JavaScript challenge.  I see that JavaScript is going to be an " arduous" and "perhaps" interesting journey.

Time Spent: 1 hour

Thoughts: I am scared and I am only on day 4 ...aaaaaah! Thank you FCC!

Day 5: Even more exhausted from work, but completed my  hour. I hope over the weekend, I can dedicate more hours to my new passion!
 I realised I can't focus on my FCC Responsive Web Design projects during the work week, so I've put that on pause till the weekend & started learning JavaScript. It is early days but I am sure I would find learning #Klingon easier than JS! 


Time spent: a little more than an hour

Thoughts: I need to pre-schedule my coding hour, otherwise, I might find it hard to complete this  challenge!

Day 6: So I am moving along slowly through the beginning of FCC's JavaScript Algorythmn and Data Structure course. I got stuck at 25%. I hate it when I get stuck and at times getting unstuck fills up almost half of my hour i am meant to be coding. 


Time spent: 2hours

Thoughts: Day 7 tomorrow, will mean, i will have coded for a week! I am so excited about this funny and non-anticpated journey! I also need to learn how to use Twitter properly. I am also sharing my journey on that platform. I think I have received some likes and perhaps some retweet! Having said that, I need to learn about github and codepen, both platforms i am currently using but know just about an iota about both. Buth thank you GITHUB for your support!!

Day 7: I cannot believe that I managed a week of coding.(It seems that i forgot  to write my Day 7, so wrote it on Day 8)

Time spent: 2 hours

Thoughts: A week, woop woop. Another 93 days to go.

---------
#100DaysOfCode 1st August started at 1am and finished at 2am

Day 8: I managed to squeeze my hour, i was awake but the last five minutes were tough.


Time spent: an hour

Thoughts: I need to make sure that i do my coding during day time and not before going to bed, as i am so tired so not able to fully focus on coding.
