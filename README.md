Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode 25th of July
Day 1: Started Friday evening 24th of July 2020 and finished  half past midnight 25th of July 2020

Today's Progress: I am a newbie to coding and currently working on Responsive Web Design- I got stuck on a section of CSS Grid and I just can't seem to resolve the code. I hope tomorrow, I will figure it out. 

Time Spent: around 2hours.

Thoughts: Was feeling good until i got stuck on the 17 part of 22 sections.
